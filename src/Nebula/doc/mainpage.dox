\subsection virt_hier Virtual Function Hierarchy

In certain virtual functions, base class implementations must be called.
In the interest of consistency and organization, a standard pattern will be followed.
Any given derived implementation will first call its immediate base class implementations
strating with the lowest base class in the hierarchy.

Care must be taken to ensure that every derived impl calls the appropriate base impls.
